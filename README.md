## 📖 Glossary
To ensure clarity across all repository tables, we classify tools using the following parameters:
- **Engine Classification**:
  - **Local Inference**: Requires access to local hardware resources (GPUs/TPUs) or is optimized for edge/local deployment using quantized models.
  - **API-based**: Execution relies heavily or entirely on managed external endpoints (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini APIs).
  - **Hybrid**: Can operate utilizing both local system intelligence and fallback/routing to external provider APIs.
- **Deployment Mode**: The primary interface for utilizing the tool (e.g., *CLI*, *Web UI*, *Docker*, *Library* / *SDK*).
